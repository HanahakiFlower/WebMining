# WebMining
A repository to post the final test I did in my university's web mining course.

In this repository there are:
- Data scraping using the scrapy framework;
- SQLAlchemy integration to record usernames and their respective encrypted passwords;
- A process in which only authenticated users can access the dashboard made with streamlit;
- A dashboard that analyzes the data collected through different charts powered by the streamlit framework and the plotly library.

To see what other technologies were used, check the "requirements.txt" file to see the listing.
